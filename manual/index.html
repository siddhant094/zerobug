                <strong>18.3 Handling Of Phosphoric Acid</strong> <br /><strong
                    class="ql-size-large"
                    >General</strong
                ><br /><span class="ql-size-large"
                    >Phosphoric Acid exists as a colourless crystal at room
                    temperature, and it melts at 210C (Pure). In it</span
                >s liquid form it is clear syrup, and when it is sufficiently
                diluted, phosphoric acid has a pleasing acid taste. Phosphoric
                Acid continues to change as you heat it more. When it reaches a
                temperature of 2000C, it becomes Pyro-phosphoric acid, and at
                3000 C it becomes Meta-phosphoric acid. H3PO4 is also soluble in
                both water and alcohol. The presence of Sulphate (SO4), Fluoride
                (F) and Chloride (Cl) in the ‘BK PAC’ and ‘GREEN PAC’ may cause
                corrosion on stainless steels. The presence of ferric (Fe) and
                aluminium (Al) ions is beneficial from a corrosion point of
                view. When the composition of the Phosphoric Acid is changing,
                i.e. an increase of the Fluoride or Chloride concentration, more
                severe corrosion is to be expected. After discharge the tanks
                have to be cleaned with fresh water as soon as possible. After
                cleaning the Chlorides have to be removed from the tanks as soon
                as possible by steaming and mopping of the condensed water.<br /><strong

                sufficient acid resistant hoses for the cargo transfer. Ensure
                to have on board sufficient acid spray shields to cover flanges
                on manifold and hose connections according to IBC code 15.11.4
                and BCH code 4.8.4. If it is expected that the particular acid
                contain sediments ensure to have on board sufficient portable
                acid resistant equipment for recirculation of acid tanks for
                discharge operation.<br /><br />High wear and tear on pumps
                cargo seals from acid containing sediments can be expected.
                Cargo pump seal (cargo seal &amp; oil seal) integrity should
                carefully be examined prior to loading.<br /><br />Phosphoric
                Acids are shipped as different grades which may vary on purity
                and acid concentration (e.g. Food grade, wet processed
                fertilizer grade, commercial, etc). For proper handling ensure
                the grade is known, and that the specific information requested
                by the steel manufacturer is obtained. Few of the examples of
                types of grades of Phosphoric Acid is given below:<br /><strong

                ><strong>ure Phosphoric Acid: </strong>Since pure Phosphoric
                Acid (80% solution) is used asadditives in food and beverages, a
                very high degree of tank cleanliness is necessary. Check with
                the Ship Operator if a wall wash is required. Pure Phosphoric
                Acid 80% freezes at 50C and may therefore require heating in
                cold climate. Steam must not be used for heating, as maximum
                allowable coil temperature is 90°C. Heating must be done with
                adjacent cargoes or by use of water or thermal oil<br /><strong

                    >W</strong
                ><strong>et Process Phosphoric Acid: </strong>Almost all wet
                process phosphoric Acids containsolid particles that may form
                adherent deposits. The steel surface of the tank top may be
                attacked during the voyage. Therefore, arrangement for circulate
                the liquid above the tank top should be prepared. In some cases
                the cargo acid may be loaded at temperatures greater than
                ambient. Depending upon the origin this can have an adverse
                effect on the stainless steel. It is important the Ship Operator
                is consulted before loading any Phosphoric Acid that is over
                400C. If the temperature of the acid is exceeding 500C the cargo
                will normally not be loaded. The solids (impurities) in the WPA
                will quickly settle out and build up a thick heavy sediment
                layer on the tank top. This sediment layer, if left undisturbed
                could block the pump impeller and make pumping impossibly. To
                prevent pump blockage, it is necessary 10 blows the pumpstack
                with compressed air at least once a day. The pump should be run
                slowly, a few minutes to ensure that the impeller is operating
                freely.<br /><strong class="ql-size-large">S</strong
                ><strong>uper Phosphoric Acid:</strong> The SPA should be heated
                and kept at a temperature of65°C. Maximum Temperature: 82°C.
                Minimum Temperature: 60°C. Excessive heat rapidly degrades the
                SPA. At temperatures below 600C, the SPA becomes very viscous
                and un-pumpable. Maximum allowable temperature on the heat media
                is 90°C.<br /><strong> </strong

                experienced. In such cases care must be taken not to quickly
                open or close valves in the pump system as this causes pressure

                    Discharge the small tanks first. Flush sediments out of the

                >he corrosion phenomena occurring in wet process phosphoric acid
                are very complex. This acid can therefore be regarded as the
                most difficult chemical that can be carried in stainless steel
                tanks. A normal concentration of wet acid is 54%. A clean acid
                of this strength is not very corrosive to stainless steel. The
                corrosion is affected by various impurities normally present in
                wet process acid.<br /><br />Preferably, fresh water should be
                used as cleaning medium but if not available large amounts of
                seawater must be used&#47;added to the tank. In addition to
                using all available tank-cleaning machines put additional water
                into the tank using ballast pump. Ensure the tank and its
                associated line system is cleaned until all deposits are washed
                out and a neutral PH value is obtained.<br /><br />Just prior to
                stopping the cleaning of the tank ensure all line systems and
                hoses used are free from acid&#47;acid residue. Acid&#47;sea
                water mixture remaining in lines and stainless steel hoses will
                soon result in pitting.<br /><br />The slops are to be disposed
                according to: Regulations for control of pollution by noxious
                liquid substances in bulk, IMO, MARPOL Annex II.
